# Tengo Full Stack case


## Dev Quickstart
1. Clone the repo
```
git clone git@github.com:tender-cc/fullstack-case.git
cd fullstack-case
npm install
```

2. 
Start the fake backend server :
```
cd backend-mock
node server.js
```

3. Start the front
```
npm start
```

## Context
`backend-mock`folder contains a mock of how our backend behaves. 
It mainly has 2 tables (in memory for th purpose of the exercice - stored in file `database.js`)
- Tenders : the data that was collected about some tenders
- Interaction : table that contains the decision a user took about some tenders

There are 2 endpoints
- `POST /tenders/search` to get the  tender matching the criterias. This endpoint has been simplified for the purpose of this exercice (for instance we donâ€™t pass parameters to the search endpoint).
- `POST /interactions/decisionStatus` to take a decision on a tender and store it in the database

The content of the `src/` folder is a boilerplate React app. You have to adapt it to implement the stream feature.

## Tools & libraries used in the project
This project was bundled using Vite, React & Typescript
